## How to create your database?
* Enter your database username. (In my case, it is 'root')
* Enter your database password. (In my case, it is empty, because I didn't set any password)
* Enter your MySQL server port number. (In my case, it is 3306. It may be 3308 in your case)
* Click on Login!
* After creating the database, now you can also view it as a user!
